Improved retry logic.

LGIST will no longer mindlessly retry the next unit in the queue. Instead,
it will keep track of the number of retries, and once a threshold is reached
that unit will be kicked down into the stale queue, or if already there, out
of the queues altogether. It should no longer be possible for LGIST to get
stuck on inspecting a particular unit due to the server refusing to provide
information on it. This should address ticket #7, point 2.

Further, if the player is dead, no inspection attempts will be made.
This should address ticket #7, point 3.
